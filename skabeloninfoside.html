    <h2>About Democratic Coffee</h2>
    <p>
        Located in the busy Krystalgade in Copenhagen’s centre, close to Nørreport, this coffee shop is named after its location in one of the most democratic places you’ll find – the library.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every day, Democratic Coffee attracts lots of students, business people or whoever just want a great cup of coffee, often accompanied by the speciality of the café – their almond croissant, which is freshly baked at the spot twice a day.
        Just like the famous pastry, all the baked goodies are homemade right behind the counter.
    </p>
        But, most importantly is of course the coffee. Democratic Coffee specialises in single-origin, lightly roasted coffee which they’ve just recently started selling as beans as well. The small company don’t have the capacity to roast in-house, so they head over to The Factory at Refshaleøen, where you can book a coffee roaster – who knew that was a thing?
        If you’re looking for a good place to study, read the paper or enjoy your morning coffee in the vibrant heart of Copenhagen, this place is worth a visit.
