        <h2>About Original Coffee</h2>
        <p>
            The story of Original Coffee began back in 2010 when childhood friends Nikolaj and Philip set out on their bikes to offer coffee to the Copenhagen population. We started as "Rolling Coffee," but in 2012, we made a decision to change the company's name to "Original Coffee" with the subtitle "Brewed by Friends." Over time, we have undergone significant growth and now count 15 coffee bars spread throughout Copenhagen. In addition to these coffee bars, we have also collaborated with Tivoli, where you can now find 3 Original Coffee coffee stands in the amusement park.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Original Coffee, coffee and excellent service are top priorities, indicating well-trained baristas committed to guiding and delivering an extraordinary coffee experience to our guests. To make the visit to one of our coffee bars more unique for each guest, in 2022, we purchased an old butcher location in KÃ¸dbyen, which we transformed into a bakery. This bakery now serves as a daily supplier of freshly baked bread and high-quality pastries to our 18 coffee bars.
        </p>
        As an extension of our coffee bars, we also operate an online webshop where we offer equipment, coffee beans, and the option for coffee subscriptions. This way, we meet our goal of providing an exceptional coffee experience to our guests, whether they enjoy it at our coffee bars or in the comfort of their own homes.
